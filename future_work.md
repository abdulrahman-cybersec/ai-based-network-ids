# Future Work

This project provides a foundational framework for educational AI-based intrusion detection. Several improvements and extensions can be explored in future work:

---

## 1. Real-Time Intrusion Detection

Future versions of the system may support real-time network traffic analysis, enabling faster detection and response to potential threats.

---

## 2. Deep Learning Integration

Advanced deep learning models such as neural networks and LSTM architectures could be implemented to improve detection accuracy and handle complex attack patterns.

---

## 3. Integration with SIEM Systems

The system could be integrated with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms to enhance log correlation and centralized security monitoring.

---

## 4. Dataset Expansion

Additional datasets representing diverse network environments and attack types may be used to improve model generalization and robustness.

---

## 5. Scalability and Performance Optimization

Future enhancements may focus on optimizing system performance and scalability to support larger network environments.
