# Methodology

This project follows a structured and ethical methodology to design and evaluate an educational AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). All experiments were conducted in simulated environments using publicly available datasets.

---

## 1. Data Collection

Publicly available network intrusion datasets were used to simulate realistic network traffic scenarios. The datasets include both normal and malicious traffic patterns. No real systems, users, or sensitive data were involved in this project.

---

## 2. Data Processing

The collected data was prepared using the following steps:

- Data cleaning and normalization  
- Removal of incomplete and inconsistent records  
- Feature selection relevant to network behavior  
- Labeling traffic as normal or intrusion  
- Preparing datasets for machine learning model training  

---

## 3. Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were applied to detect intrusion patterns:

- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

These models were selected due to their effectiveness in classification tasks and their common use in cybersecurity research.

---

## 4. System Implementation

The intrusion detection system was implemented in a simulated and offline environment. This approach ensures safe experimentation while allowing performance evaluation under controlled conditions.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

The system performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Detection accuracy  
- Intrusion detection rate  
- False positive rate  

These metrics help assess the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed IDS.

---

## 6. Ethical Considerations

All experiments were conducted for educational and academic purposes only. The project follows ethical cybersecurity standards and does not involve real-world attacks, unauthorized access, or exploitation of systems.
