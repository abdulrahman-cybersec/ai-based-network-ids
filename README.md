# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Project Overview
This project presents an educational AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System designed to detect malicious and abnormal network behavior using machine learning techniques. The system is developed for academic and cybersecurity learning purposes in a safe and simulated environment.

## Objectives
- Design an AI-based intrusion detection system
- Detect malicious and abnormal network traffic
- Apply machine learning techniques in cybersecurity defense
- Demonstrate ethical and safe cybersecurity experimentation
- Support academic learning and research in cybersecurity

## Methodology
The system uses publicly available intrusion detection datasets to simulate network traffic. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and labeling were performed before training machine learning models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify intrusion patterns.

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Environment: Simulated educational environment

## Project Documentation
The full project documentation is available in PDF format:

## Ethical Considerations
All experiments were conducted using public datasets in simulated environments. No real systems or users were involved.
